To minimize the number of hits, you need to arrange the references in the sequence so that 2 identical references are at a distance greater than the number of pages.
 And to maximize hits, on the contrary, you need to place the same references as close as possible. 
 For miss, the opposite is true, since the number of hits and miss depends on each other (total = hits + miss)
